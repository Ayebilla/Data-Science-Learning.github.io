## Identifying Twitter communities: Asimple approach

Twitter users choose the users they follow and the topics they tweet about carefully. This has led to a growing interest among Data Scientist and business owners trying to identify and categorize users based on their interests so that they may target them with products or issues of interest to them. This is an area that has attracted academicians and many [academic papers](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210689), (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188702&type=printable), (https://firstmonday.org/article/view/2745/2681#:~:text=The%20four%20meta%E2%80%93categories%20of,or%20shortened%20URL%20and%20%E2%80%9Cnews) have been published outlining different strategies to use in discovering twitter communities. Many of such papers are overly complex and fail to speak to the needs of beginners. This paper seeks to present a very basic and simple approach to identifying twitter communities using hashtags in users' tweets.
